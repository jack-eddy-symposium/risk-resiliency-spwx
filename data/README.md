# Process for preparing integrated event data files
- Download the GIC sensors data from the NERC ERO Portal https://eroportal.nerc.net
- Unzip all files in the downloaded folder
- Add to a new folder in 'data' that is titled 'event_YYYYMMDD/GIC/'
- Process through 'integrate_NERC_event_data.ipynb' to align with the solar wind and geomagnetic activity indices
- Save to an integrated file folder for further analyses
